## How I Think About Engineering

I focus on building systems that scale in **performance, maintainability, and team ownership**.

My work is driven by:
- Clear architectural boundaries
- Measurable performance improvements
- Designing SDKs and features for long-term evolution

I have worked across consumer and merchant-facing applications, often owning features end-to-end—from problem definition to rollout and iteration.
